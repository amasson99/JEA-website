<b>Membership:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> I’m thrilled to report increased membership numbers. JEA now boasts 3040 total members. That is the largest number of members in JEA’s history. It has been a goal of the association to breach the
  3,000 mark for many years, and you have helped reach that lofty objective. The increase was almost entirely from voting memberships with an 11 percent overall increase from the same time last fall.</span>

<b>Happenings:</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">May 9-12:  Business Professionals of America National Leadership Conference, Dallas, Texas</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">June 4-6: Strategic Council meeting for Partnership for 21st Century Learning, Washington D.C.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">July 10-12: JEA Advisers Institute, Las Vegas</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">July 29-31: Site visit for potential future convention, Portland.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">August 8-10: Site visit for potential future convention, Philadelphia.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">August 11: Planning meeting for 2019 Fall National JEA/NSPA Convention, Washington D.C.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">August 24-25: Planning meeting for 2018 Fall National JEA/NSPA Convention, Chicago</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">September 18: Kansas Scholastic Press Association Fall Conference, Manhattan, Kansas</span>

<b>For the board:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The summer and fall have been productive as headquarters continues to develop a new Write-off system and polish the updated JEA.org website. Several new convention initiatives have been planned
  and implemented in Chicago. JEA will offer on-site certification testing in a new computer lab. The lab will also provide an opportunity for students to experience hands-on session programing at the convention. There is a new student pizza party
  as well as a new grant opportunity for first-time attendees.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">As of Sept. 26 — about a quarter of the way through the fiscal year — JEA has a net operating loss of $75,263.75. That loss is worse when factoring in our investments, which have lost $9,731.78 so far this fiscal
  year, giving the organization a total net loss of $84,995.53. However, none of these figures factor in any revenue from the Chicago convention. JEA’s net assets still remain strong at $1,608,886.24.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Preparing the fall report is a welcome opportunity to pause and reflect. With so many cool things in motion, our team hasn’t slowed down. I’m grateful for their efforts and for the many roles our leaders juggle as
  teachers and advisers in addition to their targeted approach to board goals and initiatives. It continues to be an honor to serve this organization. We can agree that our work matters more than ever as journalism educators.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">A particularly bright spot you’ll likely hear more than once in this report cycle is the milestone that JEA membership hit 3,000 for the first time in years. I have no doubt that increase is the combination of
  outreach efforts and member benefits. Our state directors in particular do a fantastic job connecting teachers with the many services and programs JEA provides. If you had a personal conversation with even one prospective member, you helped
  strengthen our community — thank you!</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the past six months, some of my efforts have included:</span>
<ul>
  <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Working with Executive Director Kelly Glasscock, CJE, and Vice President Val Kibler, MJE, during a strategic planning session June 1 at K-State</span></li>
  <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Appointing Kelly Furnas, MJE, to serve as </span><a href="http://jea.org/wp/blog/2018/06/18/nichols-appoints-global-engagement-director/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">global
        engagement director</span></a></li>
  <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Conducting a search to fill a vacancy on the board of directors and </span><a href="http://jea.org/wp/blog/2018/07/11/laura-negri-appointed-director-large/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">appointing</span></a><span
      style="font-weight: 400;"> Laura Negri, CJE, to the director-at-large position</span></li>
  <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Coordinating the Team Storytelling workshop and presenting sessions at JEA Advisers Institute in Las Vegas July 9-12</span></li>
  <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Coordinating the development of training videos and materials for publications judges and student media evaluators</span></li>

      style="font-weight: 400;"> for up to 1,500 teacher/adviser members</span></li>
  <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Developing partnerships with </span><a href="https://quillandscroll.org/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Quill &amp; Scroll</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, such as free
      Q&amp;S membership to student Journalist of the Year state winners who enter the national competition, co-sponsorship of the Student Journalist Impact Award and plans to collaborate on an update to the Principal’s Guide to Scholastic
      Journalism</span></li>
  <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Serving on the </span><a href="https://www.spj.org/index.asp"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Society of Professional Journalists</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Journalism

      Baltimore and serving on a panel about the needs of scholastic journalism educators and their students</span></li>
</ul>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">I also have been able to help in some ways near and dear to my heart, such as proctoring certification exams to JEANC members in Northern California, </span><a href="http://www.jeadigitalmedia.org/author/sarah-nichols/"><span
    style="font-weight: 400;">posting</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on the digital media site and contributing to the </span><a href="http://jeasprc.org/brett-kavanaughs-1983-yearbook-provides-teachable-moments/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">SPRC
    blog</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. One of the day-to-day highlights is working to empower all of our appointed leaders. They do incredible work for our members, and I am continually impressed by their efforts.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Equally impressive is the work by our headquarters staff. Kelly continues to juggle a million responsibilities with patience and grace while moving us forward. I am grateful to Connie, Pam, Lisa and Kate for the ways
  they support our members and our team. We have so much more we want and need to do to further JEA’s mission — and together we will!</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Halfway through my term on the board, I still continue to be overwhelmed by the number of volunteers who give so freely of their time, energy and talents to further JEA’s mission. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In the time since last spring’s semiannual report, I’ve been involved in a variety of ways, which include:</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Since the last report, I have worked on several items for the Scholastic Press Rights Committee. It truly is an honor to serve this group and organization. I’m humbled by the great work done by people working on SPRC.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">SPRC functions by teams with multiple people helping in a variety of areas. Members are Jane Blystone, MJE, Candace Bowen, MJE, John Bowen, MJE, Lindsay Coppens</span><b>, </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vince
  DeMiero, Hilary Devoss, Chris Evans, Janet Ewell, MJE, Megan Fromm, MJE, Tom Gayda, MJE, Mark Goodman, Marina Hendricks, CJE, Emilee Hussack, Cyndi Hyatt, CJE, Val Kibler, MJE, Jeff Kocur, CJE. Michael Malcom-Bjorklund, CJE,</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Jackie

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to the specific items listed below, all SPRC members work with students and advisers who contact us with questions concerning press law and ethics. </span>

<b>Blogs: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">The blog team posts content weekly 11 months of the year. (We take mid June to mid July off.) Contributors are John Bowen (4 blogs since last report), Candace Perkins Bowen (3), Lindsay Coppens (1),
  Cyndi Hyatt (1), Lori Keekley (2), Sarah Nichols (2) and Stan Zoller (3).</span>

<b>Constitution Day (led by Jeff Kocur and Matt Smith) contributors include John Bowen, Lori Keekley, Susan McNulty: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jeff Kocur and Matt Smith oversaw these</span><a href="http://jeasprc.org/ways-to-celebrate-constitution-day-2018/"><span
    style="font-weight: 400;"> plans and resources</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> including seven new lessons and activities — and links to still relevant past topics. </span>

<b>Write-offs: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Michael Malcolm Bjorkland and Jeff Kocur wrote the spring and fall tests (respectively) and judges include Candace Bowen, John Bowen, Vince DeMiero, Megan Fromm, Marina Hendricks, Lori Keekley and
  Kathy Schrier.</span>

<b>Podcasts (led by Mike Simons): </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">The first installment of a series of podcasts titled “Conversations at the schoolhouse gate: The New Voices podcast” was just released in late September. These podcasts will
  center on issues of importance to the First Amendment and the New Voices movement. We will continue to work on and produce these.</span>

<b>Social media (John Bowen, Vince DeMiero, Marina Hendricks, Jane Blystone, Glenn Morehouse Olson)</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">This group posts to social media daily promoting information and SPRC offerings. If you don’t already, follow us @jeapressrights and like us on Facebook.</span>

<b>Website transition (John Bowen, Marina Hendricks, Lori Keekley): </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’ve visited</span><a href="http://jeasprc.org"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">jeasprc.org </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">during
  the past month, you probably noticed a change. We switched the look and some of the organization of the site. Most of this work was done during a retreat (John Bowen, Marina Hendricks, Lori Keekley) this summer in Minneapolis. Please know
  this is a work in progress. We are still working to create easy ways to find the wealth of information on the site.</span>

<b>Panic Button responders (Vince DeMiero, John Bowen, Lori Keekley, Mark Goodman, Jane Blystone, Matt Smith, Val Kibler): </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">We developed a protocol for handling SPRC Panic Buttons which outlines the steps to take
  after someone requests help. Also, those working on the buttons are no longer separated based on type of student media. Additionally, I reach out to those (individually) on the listserv when they post about censorship or prior review issues. We
  have worked with three schools so far this year on Panic Buttons.</span>

<b>FAPFA Award: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">I worked with NSPA and Quill &amp; Scroll on the questions for this award. Together we decided to change some portions and include a separate administrator application for round two, which should
  help streamline the application. First round applications are due by Dec. 15. Applications can be found either on the JEA page or</span><a href="https://www.surveygizmo.com/s3/4526823/2018-19-First-Amendment-Press-Freedom-Award"><span style="font-weight: 400;">here</span></a><span
  style="font-weight: 400;">. </span>

<b>New Voices (Mark Goodman, John Bowen, Hilary Devoss, Chris Evans, Lori Keekley, Val Kibler, Kathy Schrier, Mike Simons, Sarah Nichols, John Tagliareni, Stan Zoller): </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">I worked to find the state leaders for those
  working on legislation. The SPRC New Voices team contacted those working on legislation in states. We are working to be a resource for those working on legislation — especially in helping coordinate the grassroots efforts. Group members have
  signed up for states, reached out and notified the contacts of the upcoming JEA New Voices Summit at the Chicago convention.</span>
<ul>
  <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Las Vegas: I taught a four-hour workshop with two goals. The first goal was to educate participants whose states had already passed student free expression legislation.  The second goal
      was to help those working on legislation in whatever stage they were.</span></li>
  <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chicago: The purpose is for state organizers and activists to share strategies, plan for the 2018-19 legislative sessions and generate creative ideas to build national momentum. We have
      three main components: if needed a small educational piece on New Voices, a panel (New Voices team and Hadar Harris from SPLC), and some time to talk and brainstorm about problems and issues people have in small groups. The hope is for all of
      us to learn from each other collaboratively. I sent out a reminder email to those who have been identified as leaders of the New Voices movement by JEA state directors.</span></li>
</ul>
<b>Website: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">John Bowen, Marina Hendricks and I met to update and reorganize jeasprc.org. The site went through several conceptual iterations. We will continue to progress through work on the site.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">As always, please let me know if you have any suggestions or questions. I’m always happy to help.]</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">This fall, I transitioned back into the high school journalism classroom after teaching at the university level for the last 10 years. I’m thrilled to be back with young student journalists and advising a student
  newspaper. I’m happy to report that the learning curve is both exciting and humbling! Since my last report, my work has been entirely focused on the curriculum as I switch gears professionally. This work includes:</span>
<ul>
  <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Working with curriculum coordinators Shari Adwers, MJE, and Abri Nelson, CJE, as we have moved into the phase of implementing the revisions and corrections our leaders are working on.
      This means fixing broken links, gradually rearranging lessons into meaningful units, and implementing our goals for increased usability and differentiation by identifying and tagging lessons appropriate for all levels. By the time this goes to
      print, our first official round of those curriculum updates should be well underway.</span></li>
  <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the back end of the site, we are continuing to seek ways to make the curriculum more user-friendly and engaging for our members.</span></li>
  <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Responding to member requests or questions about the curriculum on social media and via email, including navigating lessons and putting resources to use.</span></li>
  <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Checking in with our grantees for the the JEA/NSPA research grant.</span></li>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Now that we have had four years following a shift in awards to digital submission, we are able to begin looking at more information from those who are submitting nominations and applications. With the changes to the
  JEA website, the committee is again looking at potential language issues that might pose problems/confusion when we meet here in Chicago on Saturday. Connie and Kate have been very good about communication regarding the awards section of the
  website. Per usual, the awards committee is great about having a lens on things we need to revisit, and there will be several of those conversations this fall.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Since the last report, the following has taken place:</span>
<ul>
  <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jeff Browne of Quill and Scroll has signed on to partner with JEA for the Student Journalism Impact Award. Jeff is eager to have his organization on board, and will begin advertising
      the award this fall. The committee will be working to ensure there is recognition for the team that had been organizing and selecting this award under the direction of Ken Siver.</span></li>
  <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">This summer, Adam Dawkins, CJE, Michelle Coro,CJE, former Broadcast Adviser of the Year Alyssa Boehringer, CJE, Robby Gabrielli (a professional in the broadcast world), and Karen
      Slusher were the judges for the Broadcast Adviser of the year.</span></li>
  <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">We saw a surge of applications from several new people for BAOY, but it is clear this award still needs to grow more within our organization.</span></li>
  <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">We again announced the fall awards in a timed series (10 a.m. Central) at the end of August, but we postponed the announcement of BAOY because of complications with judges initially and
      then the school’s request for a date in early October. BAOY was announced on Oct. 2 in the afternoon during a full faculty meeting. Again the chair called all recipients a day ahead of the formal announcement of awards. Kelly Glasscock has
      helped step in to coordinate luncheon attendance and Evelyn Lauer coordinated the release of winners on social media.</span></li>
  <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The committee has also been faced with several recent questions regarding the requirement for membership when it comes to the awards. This conversation has been taking place online
      among the committee members but will continue this Saturday. This conversation mostly impacts the Rising Star award. We will present finalized language to JEA in order for the website to be updated in time for the 2019 fall awards nominations.</span></li>
  <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">This will be the third year of the Future Administrator Scholarship. We saw an increase in applications last year, but we would like to see more people with an advising background see
      this as a possible option. Again, as part of this award, a $5,000 award will be shared among recipients or awarded in full to one recipient. The deadline for this award application is Dec. 15.</span></li>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">It is truly an exciting time for the CTE committee as we begin preparations for the Chicago conference to launch the opportunity for students and teacher’s additional options to receive certifications through
  Precision and Certiport exam platforms. JEA will offer testing times on Saturday morning. Options provided by both exam companies have been narrowed down to digital photography and broadcast certifications through Precision exams and Adobe
  Photoshop or InDesign through Certiport. The option to sign up for the exams is listed when an adviser registers students for the convention.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">If a communications program is recognized under the CTE umbrella, participating in certification opportunities will assist in demonstrating that the program is highly qualified in the pathway of study. Remember,
  having opportunities for students to receive industry certification is an important component for CTE recognition. It is important to remember that if programs are currently classified as a CTE program or are trying to work into this pathway of
  study under the CTE umbrella, certifications for both the adviser and students add to meeting full compliance for the program receiving funds under the Carl D. Perkins grant.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">My main goal is to continue to move the needle forward for journalism programs to be viewed as CTE pathways of study to assist with funding issues and additional resources for the classroom.  </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Next steps include working on a CTE tab for the JEA website. I have reached out to the CCRB in New Mexico to assist me in building the opening copy to discuss why journalism educators should consider building CTE
  programs. They have also pulled together additional resources for research consideration for instructors who are trying to pull together a pathway of study. The challenge that I am running into is figuring out a logical order to move through
  information and resources. Additional challenges include gathering information by state as CTE programs are not consistent in states, but rather programs vary from school district to school district and sometimes will vary in schools within the
  same school districts.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">This biannual report starts with a salute to outgoing Certification Committee member Liz Walsh, MJE, who resigned her position over the summer. For over a decade, Liz’s impact on JEA Certification has been
  wide-ranging and critical to our mission. From updating the CJE exam to encouraging CJEs to continue to grow and to contribute their expertise, Liz has advanced Certification through her extensive knowledge, creativity and excellence-centered
  focus. A true educator, Liz will continue to teach and encourage advisers for the benefit of their students in her new role with Walsworth Yearbooks. On behalf of the Certification Committee, I thank her for her exceptional service and wish her
  well in her new career!</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">We have opened the application process to replace Liz through a Listserv post. The deadline to complete the application is Oct. 19 at 5 p.m. EDT. We hope to have a new member named prior to the convention in Chicago.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Here is what we’ve done since the last report:</span>
<ul>
  <li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Spring and summer were busy test times! In April and May, we tested 15 CJE candidates and 4 MJE candidates at three sites in the spring -- San Francisco, Florida Scholastic Press Association’s spring conference
      in Orlando, and Palo Alto High School. This summer, we tested 28 CJEs and 3 MJEs at five sites – Ball State University, Walsworth Camp Orlando, Josten’s Adviser University, JEA Advisers Institute, and Walsworth Adviser Academy in Kansas City.</span></li>
  <li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> We will be testing 30 CJE candidates and six MJE candidates in Virginia in October and Chicago in November.</span></li>
  <li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> We will recognize 46 new CJEs, 24 CJE renewals, five new MJEs and five MJE renewals in Chicago at Saturday’s luncheon.</span></li>
  <li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> As I mentioned in my spring biannual report, our Certification Committee retreat in Indianapolis in May 2019 is a go. During this long weekend, we will analyze data from both versions of the CJE exam and look
      at areas for improvement, update our “Get Certified!” PowerPoints to align with the JEA Curriculum and examine MJE exam updates.</span></li>
  <li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Once again, I want to publicly thank Pam Boller, our JEA Headquarters Certification partner who supports us, our CJEs and MJEs and our candidates. I could not do this without her!</span></li>

<b>Events:</b>

<b>1) National Journalism Quiz Bowl</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">We had 31 teams compete in Dallas in the Fall 2017 and had 24 teams in San Francisco last spring. Allie is looking for ways to increase numbers and has created flyers for each convention.</span>

<b>2) Jr. High/Middle School Contest </b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">There were 394 entries in the Spring 2018 contest, up from 330 entries in Spring 2017.  This contest continues to grow each spring as word gets out to our jr. high and middle school members. Upcoming contest dates are
  as follows:</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Registration opens April 1</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Materials due April 17 @ 7 p.m. ET</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Judging finished and winners announced early May </span>

<b>3)</b> <b>Upcoming Deadlines</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">-</span><b>Spring 2019 Anaheim (April 25-28)</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Write-off registration opens / prompts available: Tuesday, Feb. 19</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Write-off registration closes/online submissions due: March 27</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Critiques due from judges April 17</span>

<b>4) Contest </b><b>Numbers</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">We had </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">1,581 contestants for the Dallas Fall 2017 (32 percent of convention attendance) and for San Francisco we had 1,568 contestents (35 percent of convention attendance) which
  was a big jump for a spring convention. Perhaps having the awards on Saturday will help to increase numbers in the spring.</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">We will look at contest numbers this summer and determine if we need to
  eliminate/replace any individual contests due to consistently low entry numbers. Our participation is steady, averaging 34 percent each convention, but we have set a goal to increase that number as we do have many contests that do not max out each
  time.</span>

<b>5) </b><b>Partnering with SJW</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The Graphic Design Logo and Advertising contests are now partnering with the Scholastic Journalism Week team and incorporating their SJW logo/ad contest with those Write-offs in the fall. Their contest will still run
  independently and other students who are not at the convention could still enter, but this will give that team many more entries to select from each year.</span>

<b>For the board:</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">JEADigitalMedia.org has continued to grow our content and we have continually worked to reassess the most pressing needs of students and advisers. We have been tracking data so we can get a gauge of how we are doing
  with this. I will only touch on part of it here, please let me know if you’d like to have any other data and I will make sure to get it to you.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">I have decided to compare six-month periods of the site (from March 13-Sept. 13 and Sept. 14-March 12) each year that I do this. They are even six-month periods and will allow us to get an annual report together in
  time for each convention.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In our nine years of existence, we had more than 1,167 posts published (roughly 3 per week), 676,827 visits, and 1,195,371 pageviews. Thirteen different people contributed posts to the site during the past six months.
  Members were notified in the fall of 2016 to remain on the committee, they would need to contribute at least one thing to the site during the 12-month period ending Sept. 13. Five committee members are considered contributors for posting at least
  three times over the past 6 months or because they work with other parts of the site. They are:</span>

<b>Contributors:</b>
<ul>
  <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aaron Manfull - 36</span></li>
  <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Michelle Turner - 3</span></li>
  <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sarah Nichols - 3</span></li>
  <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Michelle Harmon - 3</span></li>
  <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kyle Phillips - Maintaining maps</span></li>
</ul>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Also contributing to the site during the time period was Matthew Schott, Jim Streisel, Michael Simons, Amanda Bright, Matthew LaPorte, Jonathan Rogers, Kathryn Campbell, Don Goble and Tripp Robbins.  </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">While some of the wording is cut off on the following charts, the graphs move from the least recent 6-month period on top to the most recent 6-month period, on the bottom.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Below are the most clicked posts/pages from the last 6 months:</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">We also have a presence on Twitter and Facebook (links below). With the efforts focused on creating posts and content for the site, those social accounts have not been as socially active as we would like. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The team is still working to update guides, expand guide offerings and maintain weekly posting schedules. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">As a reminder, Aaron Manfull worked to create an advertising structure for JEADigitalMedia.org. Information on advertising on the site can be found </span><a href="http://www.jeadigitalmedia.org/advertise-with-us/"><span
    style="font-weight: 400;">here.</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> School Newspapers Online has purchased the main widget area for another year. We also have a rotating ad area within posts and pages where we will work to push to summer
  journalism workshops and other advertisers as well. We currently have one that has purchased space and others that have inquired.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">We will discuss our goals at our committee meeting in Chicago, but I have a feeling we will work to continue some of our current areas of focus: 1) Continue to build a deeper broadcast presence on the site as it
  remains one of our biggest draws 2) Continue to post relevant articles for those wanting help with their online journey 3) Work to publicize the site more on the Listserv and other places to try to counteract some of the visitor trends.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">As always, if there is anything anyone would like to see on the site, please email us at </span><a href="mailto:info@jeadigitalmedia.org"><span style="font-weight: 400;">info@jeadigitalmedia.org</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">We had another great year for the Journalist of the Year contest. In April we awarded one national winner and six runners-up for this contest. After receiving 36 state-winning entries, a judging panel of 38 combed
  over each one and invested in these candidates as if they were their own student journalists. I appreciate each one of them for their dedication and talents to this tedious process. My hope each year is that this contest is given the proper
  attention to detail and is fair to all candidates. These judges did just that, as each portfolio had multiple rounds of judges looking, reading and evaluating each one.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The following students were recognized at the Saturday awards ceremony at the spring convention in San Francisco:</span>

<b>2018 National High School Journalist of the Year: </b><a href="https://christinefortjtoday.wordpress.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Christine Zhao</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thomas

<b>2018 Aspiring Young Journalist: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ariel Asher of Red Oak (Texas) Middle Schoo</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">l (</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Myia Griffith,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">

<b>Runner-up:</b> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Sydney Wilfong of Altoona (Pennsylvania) Area Junior High School </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wanda Vanish, CJE</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">,
  adviser)</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In San Francisco, we hosted our second meet-and-greet for those who participated in the 2018 national journalist of the year contest. After the first meet-and-greet, room and time accommodations changed for this year.
  A round-table format allowed attendees a more comfortable space to network. They also had two hours versus the 50-minute traditional session format. Candidates and judges attended. This was a chance for the candidates to talk with each other and
  ask questions about the contest. JEA President Sarah Nichols, MJE, and Executive Director Kelly Glasscock, CJE, also extended their congratulations in person. Attendees exchanged contact information with each other.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In San Francisco, the 2017 Journalist of the Year, Megan Bobrowsky, and I presented a session to JOY hopefuls about applying for the contest and how to build a portfolio. We gave advice from student experiences to
  help those who attended. Megan also spoke to the convention at the opening ceremony. I would like to thank Megan for her time and talents to help future candidates.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Moving forward, the requirements and guidelines for the contest are similar to last year. Refining behind the scenes will continue to take place. At the board meeting in San Francisco, I presented some facts and stats
  regarding this contest. You may access the presentation used </span><a href="https://create.piktochart.com/output/29534083-2018-spring-board-meeting-presentation"><span style="font-weight: 400;">here</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, as
  well as the meeting minutes speaking of the presentation </span><a href="http://jea.org/wp/blog/2018/04/26/board-minutes-san-francisco-2018/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">here</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Shortly after the 2018 contest concluded, JEA Executive Director Kelly Glasscock, CJE, and I started working on plans for the 2019 meet-and-greet in Anaheim. After brainstorming with the board, we felt it necessary to
  keep tweaking this event to honor and celebrate the accomplishments of our state winners. We will have more details in the spring of how we are growing this event for its third year.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The 2018 winner, Christine Zhao, will be at the fall convention in Chicago to present at the opening ceremony, as well as co-present a session about this contest. We are excited she can join us to speak with
  prospective applicants.</span>

</ul>
<b>For the Board</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Since the last Mentoring Program semiannual report was submitted, I’ve been working on the following projects:</span>
<ul>
  <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yellow Chair—This summer and the beginning of the school year was dedicated to applying for the upcoming year’s grant funding from Yellow Chair. I also worked on creating the report
      summarizing and evaluating last year’s successes and growth opportunities.</span></li>
  <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">End-of-semester and end-of-year reports—Mentors continued digital submission of their end-of-semester reports and also participated in digital submission for their end-of-year reports.
      While there were a few hiccups with submission, this process is proving to be a successful one. For the fall 2018 semester reports, we are hoping to collect more anecdotal evidence than we received in the previous year’s reports.</span></li>
  <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Database development—I created a solid database of records for mentors and mentees using the program and app Airtable. This database is shared with the mentors and with headquarters to
      consistently be keeping records updated and current. This software also allows us to download records based on defined fields and reports.</span></li>
  <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Program visibility and growth—The Mentoring Program is experiencing an exciting time full of new opportunities and experiences. The new cohort system is fully in place, which will allow
      us to streamline paperwork and programming for entering and exiting mentees to the program. These cohorts will provide unique opportunities for specialized programming, such as guest speakers and convention sessions.</span></li>
  <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Recruitment and retention—We worked diligently to find other ways to recruit mentees than what was traditional—either through state conventions or mentees reaching out to the program.
      Using social media to our advantage, we became a more proactive program and sought out people who needed help and recruited them to the program. Arguably, we were so successful with this wave of recruitment for the fall 2018 cohort that we
      have 61 mentees alone in that grouping, which is 17 mentees fewer than those currently in the program who are on their second or third year commitments. We are looking for more opportunities to recruit mentees.</span></li>
  <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reporting and requests—I worked to create a stronger tracking system for when mentees request a mentor and how long it takes to fill the request. I also created forms to add to the JEA
      website for requesting a mentor and becoming a mentor.</span></li>
</ul>
<i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Moving Forward </span></i>
<ul>
  <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Increase state membership—three new states are already looking to be added to the mentor program for the 2019-20 school year. Increasing state membership is important as mentees are
      beginning to come from states without the program and we are doing more long distance mentoring than previously.</span></li>
  <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Increase the number of mentors—our mentors are becoming increasingly strapped with the number of mentees that they are working with currently. I would like the mentors to be working
      with, on average, three mentees at a time; however, a number are working with 5+ mentees at any given time.</span></li>
  <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finding alternative mentoring methods and funding opportunities—Yellow Chair is incredible to JEA and the Mentor Program; however, we cannot continue to work solely off of state
      association and Yellow Chair funding if we are to increase mentors across the country. This will be a conversation I hope to have both with the committee and the board.</span></li>
  <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reporting strategies and digital filing—there are a number of barriers to organizational success currently, many of which are different means and methods of sending, sharing and
      evaluating reports. Ideally, we need to streamline how these files are completed so that they are a consistent file type. Additionally, we need to look more closely at how to streamline communication of the mentor program and access to it. I
      would like to go fully digital with our reporting, but the hurdle will be what we do with administrator agreement forms that must be signed.</span></li>
  <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Website updates—as the rest of JEA programming transitions to the website, so are we. Updating the Mentoring Matters website and the JEA website to have the most current information are
      important for the visibility of the program. We are looking to have a form for requesting a mentor and one for becoming a mentor.</span></li>
  <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Training—a continued discussion will be the transition to digital training of mentors and what this looks like. JEA’s use of Participate will become increasingly important for this
      process.</span></li>

<b>2019 Scholastic Journalism Week Theme: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our theme this year will be “Dedicated to Our Communities” and focus on reporting and publication that has revealed there is more to the story, uncovered previously
  unknown truths, and helped the audience navigate in-depth information.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">We will again have daily themes during the week and those will compliment student work focused around more specific areas within the theme, like the work that the JEA Scholastic Press Rights Committee New Voices are
  doing, for example.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of our daily themes will be “Saving Democracy” (thanks Jeff Browne) and will work well with our newest collaborative partnership with Jeff and his student leaders at Quill and Scroll. We will be working
  with Quill and Scroll to promote and engage with SJW 2019.</span>

<b>Scholastic Journalism Week Design Contest:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> We worked with Nancy Smith, MJE, to make the annual SJW design contest the design/logo write off for Chicago. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Of course, students may enter our contest separate from the Write-off, but this will be a great partnership and increase entries and competition for our SJW branding. The contest will open Monday, Oct. 1 and be
  promoted through social media and through the listserv.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">We would also like to reach out to programs. We need help identifying advisers and students who we can encourage to submit for the design contest. </span>

<b>SJW Design Contest Guidelines for Submission: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Using the theme “Dedicated to Our Communities,” create a design for us to use for 2019 Scholastic Journalism Week promotional materials and on social media. The
  winning logo and designer will be revealed Saturday, Nov. 3, 2018, at the JEA/NSPA National High School Journalism Convention in Chicago. The winner need not be present to win. Judges will decide on the winning design after all entries, including
  those from the convention Write-off contest, have been received. This year’s theme, “Dedicated to Our Communities,” focuses on reporting and publication that has revealed there is more to the story, uncovered previously unknown truths, and helped
  the audience navigate in-depth information.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Create your design package with the theme in mind.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Guidelines for submission:</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">ADOBE SPARK JOURNALISM PROJECT - releasing next week</span>

<b>FOR THE BOARD: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">This fall has been focused on preparing for the NCTE convention, meeting with the NCTE censorship board, updating the </span><a href="https://flipboard.com/@jeaflipboard/the-best-high-school-journalism-rsltv404y"><span
    style="font-weight: 400;">JEA Flipboard Magazine</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and helping Adobe get a new journalism project rolling.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">I can say with the help of Sarah Nichols, MJE, JEA’s relationship with NCTE is growing and is stronger than ever.  This fall we have plans to connect and grow JEA more within the NCTE organization at the convention in
  Houston. With the added JEA presence at NCTE, I only see this connection growing even more over the next year.  The theme of the convention is RAISING STUDENT VOICES and last year NCTE included several keynote sessions on the importance of
  journalism and media literacy. The Censorship Committee also is meeting this month to discuss the revised statement on censorship, banned books, and I will continue to share the</span><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1IACprU52yoqytgCttJFNvtmonL8ov1yqDnnAjGnahJE/edit?usp=sharing"><span
    style="font-weight: 400;">New Voices movement</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with NCTE regional affiliates for support.  Oct. 1 also begins the NCTE </span><a href="about:blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Why I Write</span></a><span
  style="font-weight: 400;"> Campaign.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The </span><a href="https://flipboard.com/@jeaflipboard/the-best-high-school-journalism-rsltv404y"><span style="font-weight: 400;">JEA-Flipboard magazine</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is going strong with
  5,095 followers and 186 student stories published.  This showcase is invaluable to me when spreading the word about the great work high school journalists are doing at conferences and on social media.  A push for more submissions will also be
  coming with awards for the top stories at Chicago.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">My new outreach this fall is through Adobe.  At SXSWEdu last year I snuck my way into the Adobe dinner with new connections I made after my media literacy session.  During dinner, we discussed how JEA and Adobe could
  work together. They were beginning a project on digital storytelling. I have been helping them develop this program over the summer and it is set to come out next week. The Adobe Spark digital stories created by students will be showcased at my
  presentation at the JEA conference in Chicago and possibly at SXSWEdu and ISTE.  I also applied and was accepted into the</span><a href="https://edex.adobe.com/education-leader"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Adobe Education Leaders</span></a><span
  style="font-weight: 400;"> (AEL) community.  The community is new to me, but I do have the opportunity to go to two international gatherings and connect in their online space.  </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Since my last report as the Publications/Public Relations chair, the main change to my role has been the additional responsibility of social media director, which I took over at the beginning of June. This new duty,
  which I was not anticipating, consumes much of my time, overshadowing many of the other aspects of my position.</span>

<b>Social Media: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">I update JEA’s Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram daily to a few times a week, depending on the platform and news cycle. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">My goal is increased interactivity of all social accounts. To accomplish this, I am heavily active on Twitter, retweeting and replying. I also am working to get more students involved with our social media. For
  example, for Constitution Day, I reached out to social media editors from various student publications to tell us what the First Amendment means to them and tag JEA. On Twitter, since I took over, @nationalJEA has gained 350 new followers.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the summer, we launched our #TeacherTakeover series on Instagram, which has been widely popular and helped us gain about 200 new followers. The plan is to continue this series every Tuesday via our Instagram
  Story until the end of the 2018-19 school year. Please contact </span><a href="mailto:evelau@d219.org"><span style="font-weight: 400;">evelau@d219.org</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> if you are interested in participating. </span>

<b>One Book: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 2018-2019 One Book is "The Hate U Give" by Angie Thomas, which many members seem to be reading. I will be presenting a session at the JEA/NSPA National High School Journalism Convention in Chicago
  called “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fiction as inspiration: 'The Hate U Give.'” My session will examine how Starr's story can inspire student journalists to cover challenging topics that spark change in their communities. This session
  will take place Saturday, Nov. 3 at 9 a.m. in the Toronto, Ballroom Level (West Tower).</span>

<b>SJW: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Adam Dawkins, CJE, has selected the 2019 theme as "Dedicated to our Communities." He and I are working with Nancy Smith, MJE, to incorporate this year's logo contest with JEA Write-offs. Please see his
  report for further details.</span>

<b>Online Component: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">The biggest change is the long-awaited addition of an </span><a href="http://jea.org/wp/home/for-educators/cjet/onlinesupp/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">online component to supplement the
    print edition</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The online component is a little difficult to find even if you are looking for it, as is information in the magazine itself, but it is there. The online component will make it easier for
  editors to provide answer keys to quizzes in the magazine, online support materials and links to material mentioned in the magazine. It still drives me up the wall to print URLs. I want to click on them. Everyone knows the value of these words:
  Here’s the direct link.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">I miss the searchable index of C:JET articles and authors. Maybe next summer, as time permits, I will add that back to the online portion.</span>

<b>Advertising: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our goal was to raise $3,000 for the fall issue and $4,000 for the winter issue. We fell far short of that in the fall. We sold $1,773.50 for the fall issue and $3,826 for the winter issue. With
  the $5,599.50 total, we achieved 80 percent of the goal.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Fall 2018</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">$1,773.50</span>

<b>Budget Proposals and Goals: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">As Howard Spanogle said, "JEA needs to invest money to promote a strong case for print journalism, which provides a permanent historical record of high school journalism. JEA should
  add to</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">C:JET</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">'s educational contributions by supporting innovations … ." To that end, please anticipate the upcoming proposals.</span>
<ul>
  <li style="font-weight: 400;"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Assistant editor travel</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> | I also anticipate including a formal line in the budget for upcoming years travel for the assistant editor to
      conventions to guarantee equal interactive opportunities for advisers at both conventions.  As always, the assistant editor will be available for roundtable sessions and will recruit authors and then summarize activities as part of this
      report. The goal is to observe new trends and innovative presentations as well as to report on new pressures and patterns of journalism outreach.                                      </span></li>
  <li style="font-weight: 400;"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Advisory Board meeting</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> | We will develop a formal proposal in the spring for a budget item to include a meeting of all of the </span><i><span
        style="font-weight: 400;">C:JET</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> folks, including the advisory board. This group has not met since the year it was formed except electronically. Moving forward, we anticipate meeting every three
      years.</span></li>
  <li style="font-weight: 400;"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">AEJMC Scholastic Division</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> | We will include in our spring budget proposal a budget line-item for the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">C:JET</span></i><span

      style="font-weight: 400;"> to, again, become a leader in distribution of research in scholastic journalism. This item used to be included in the budget. I attended the Scholastic Division meeting in Washington, D.C. (at my expense). It is my
      hope that the Division will have future meetings in conjunction with JEA/NSPA national conventions as I view this as a win-win. I would like to see more scholarly content in the magazine (one article per issue) and this is where to recruit for
      it.</span></li>
  <li style="font-weight: 400;"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Handouts</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> | Develop a repository of handouts derived from past issues available in a secure manner for JEA members either at minimal cost or
      free after researching the impact the service will have on our EBSCO. The process will link such handouts with curriculum material.</span></li>
</ul>
<b>JEA Advisers Institute: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">This past summer, I presented sessions at the JEA Advisers Institute with the specific intent of recruiting authors and material for the magazine. In the Winter issue, two articles have
  resulted from this connection, one by Erin Burden and another by Jenann Elias.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">I view this service as a win-win-win innovation. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The authors report on sessions and learn new material. They also get published in a national magazine. The success makes them and their school participants in professional training development. I encourage authors to
  let their administrators know about it, and our JEA executive director could communicate that value to school leaders at the adviser’s school.  JEA publicizes topics/ articles written about timely and cutting edge content from some of our
  profession’s top folks. Plus, JEA members who could not come to the Institute can learn from it. Finally, JEA receives publicity all year long about the Institute serving as a reminder for people who might be thinking about attending.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">I hope we can institutionalize this plan. The reporting the authors do, the editing process C:JET uses and the actual publication benefit everyone involved. The plan multiplies confidence for all involved. It also
  trains advisers to use an editing process that they may find helpful for their staffs.</span>

  arrived Saturday (sent about 2 to 3 weeks ago) and while I've given it only a cursory examination, it strikes me as one of the strongest issues produced because of its range of topics and especially the sophistication of the guidance provided,
  whether intelligently "watching" a recent film or reporting on student involvement in important political developments.  And discussing the use of he/she/they goes beyond simply choosing a pronoun. [Wouldn't it have simplified commenting on the
  NYTimes anonymous opinion piece if the writer(s) could have been referred to as "they"?</span>

<b>The Team: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">I cannot emphasize enough how great this team is. When Connie was going to be out of the office for an extended period, we adapted and got stuff in early. We developed plan B. Then we were elated when
  Connie got back well and early. Personally, I appreciate Howard’s willingness to step up and help identify other people who might serve as another set of eyes should Connie be unavailable. Howard does more than anyone outside JEA realizes. Howard
  and Connie have so much institutional knowledge and knowledge of the people and the profession. Howard won the NSPA Pioneer Award, JEA’s Carl Towley Award (1993) and the JEA’s Medal of Merit a decade earlier. Their knowledge and experience —
  undoubtedly — is part of what makes the magazine a continued success. Please tell them thanks when you see them.</span>

<b>Membership: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alabama has 27 JEA members. JEA membership is encouraged at Alabama Scholastic Press Association (ASPA) workshops and conferences, at Troy University’s J Day, in emails, on Facebook and by word of
  mouth. JEA membership has tremendous</span><a href="http://jea.org/wp/home/membership/benefits/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">benefits</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. When I began advising publications over 30 years ago, I became
  active in scholastic press associations. Almost everything I learned about advising came from attending their events. Advisers become active in your state (ASPA), regional (SIPA) and national organizations (JEA/NSPA &amp; CSPA). In this way your
  students can best be prepared for college, a profession and for publishing quality publications. JEA provides members access to curriculum and lesson plans. Also JEA members can be a part of an email listserv where specific questions can be asked.
  Twice a year JEA partners with National Scholastic Press Association (NSPA) to offer conventions that provide extensive training to advisers and students. JEA has certification for teachers and awards for teachers and students.</span>

<b>Membership</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Arizona currently has 58 members. In reviewing the membership report, not all members and/or board members of Arizona Interscholastic Press Association (AIPA) are members of JEA. As the state
  organization, AIPA recommends and supports new advisers becoming members of JEA and AIPA. Having two JEA mentors in our state allows for one-to-one communication with advisers who have a tendency to become more active at the state level as well as
  at the national level. The membership goal for the 2018-19 academic year would be to not only increase membership in JEA, but to encourage membership in both AIPA and JEA.</span>

<b>Events: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Summer Workshop was held in July at ASU’s Cronkite School of Journalism and Mass Communication.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The Spring Reception that was originally scheduled for April 26, 2018 was cancelled due to the Arizona Red for Ed Teacher walk out. It was held Thursday, Sept. 6, 2018 at The Old Spaghetti Factory in downtown Phoenix.
  The Freeman Hover new adviser and Forest Martin seasoned adviser were revealed and honored at this event. AIPA also added a new person to the Hall of Fame. The reception was a time to recognize all advisers for their continued work and dedication
  to the field.  </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The Fall Convention will be help Tuesday, Nov. 6, 2018 at Arizona State University in Tempe, Arizona. The contest winners will be announced after the keynote address by Steve Irvin of ABC 15. </span>

<b>Recognition: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">I would like to personally thank Carmen Wendt for her years of service as the JEA State Director as well as her many years of service to AIPA. She continues to serve as a JEA Mentor in Arizona. It
  is an honor to be able to continue to work with Carmen at the local level.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Congratulations are in order for AIPA’s winners Laura Hardy of Highland High School in Gilbert, Arizona who was recognized as the Freeman Hover Adviser of the Year and Karen Crane of McClintock High School in Tempe,
  Arizona who was recognized at the Forest Martin Adviser of the year.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Peggy Gregory, JEA Mentor and long-time AIPA board member was recognized by being inducted into AIPA’s Hall of Fame for her work as an adviser, board member, and mentoring many new advisers even prior to an official
  role as JEA Mentor.</span>

<b>Membership: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Arkansas currently has 71 JEA members.  I do not know the exact number we are up because I have been in this position for less than a year, but I do know we are up several members. </span>

<b>Major Developments: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the summer, the Arkansas Department of Education motioned a rule change that removed journalism as a required course offering for all schools in Arkansas.  In response, I emailed all
  Arkansas JEA members, informed them of the change and requested they contact their legislators. Unfortunately, that movement did not prevent a vote to remove the journalism requirement.    </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The Arkansas Legislative Panel then held a vote to determine if they would endorse the Department of Education’s motion.  Again I contacted all Arkansas JEA members and requested they contact their legislators. I also
  contacted our state band and choral organizations as their subjects were also nominated for removal.  Despite these efforts, the legislative panel voted to endorse the removal of journalism as a required class offering in Arkansas public schools.
</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Since then, I’ve emailed legislators and appeared on a local NPR affiliate to discuss these changes.  You can hear that interview </span><a href="http://www.kuaf.com/post/arkansas-board-education-votes-end-journalism-elective-requirement#stream/0"><span
    style="font-weight: 400;">here</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></a>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">One legislator is discussing passing a law to put journalism back in its rightful place.  I intend to work with him during the next legislative session. I also will begin working with our state-level
  journalism organization, Arkansas Scholastic Press Association (ASPA), to come up with a game plan.</span>

<b>ASPA News: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our state level journalism organization has seen drastic changes over the previous five months.  Our executive director, Allen Loibner-Waitkus, retired and has been replaced by Kristy Cates. We also
  saw a major change in the executive board with only one executive board member returning.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">I attended the board’s first meeting this summer and will also attend the fall meeting in October.  So far, we have reviewed board positions, the organization’s financial footing and began the process of housing ASPA
  at Arkansas State University in Jonesboro.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Our annual conference will be </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">April 18-19, 2019 at the NWA Convention Center in Springdale, Arkansas.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">One item of concern is that ASPA will no longer allow members to enroll in JEA through their ASPA membership.  I’ve contacted the new executive director and expressed my preference of continuing the previous
  arrangement. She is currently trying to get a solid foothold in running ASPA and is open to restarting next year.</span>

<b>Outreach: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’ve compiled a list of all Arkansas JEA members’ email addresses.  I’ve sent a monthly email in May, August and September. That email has highlighted services JEA offers as well as other journalism
  information.  I currently have a student aide compiling a list of journalism teachers that are not JEA members. The process is slow going as many schools are less than forthcoming with the information; however, I will begin emailing them once that
  list is complete.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">I taught two Arkansas workshops this summer.  At both workshops, I recommended JEA membership and discussed the benefits of membership. We have several new members based on those discussions. </span>

<b>Board Items: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Recently, my school has decided my students can only attend the national JEA/NSPA conference once every three years. They allow students to attend the national FBLA conference every year.
   The difference is that FBLA students must qualify at the state level before being able to compete at the national level, so the district views the FBLA conference as a greater honor.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">My district is not alone in this logic.  I would like to recommend ONE competition be held at each convention in which only schools that have won their state’s respective top award can compete.  While I understand the
  benefits and honor of ANY award won at JEA/NSPA, not all school district administrations do. I believe it’s a small change that could benefit a lot of students.</span>

<b>Wake Up Call:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Approximately 100 students and advisers representing 12 local schools attended a half- day workshop at Long Beach City College Sept. 15 to improve publications for the start of the year. The
  workshop offered breakout sessions and opportunities for newspaper and yearbook critique.</span>

<b>Journalism Day:</b> <span style="font-weight: 400;">SCJEA, Los Angeles Times High School Insider and CSUN hosted J-Day Oct. 20, an event with write-offs and break-out sessions at Cal State Northridge.</span>

<b>JEA/NSPA Spring Convention 2019: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">SCJEA local convention team, lead by chair Lacey Hatfield, has held three committee meetings since the spring convention and has confirmed a keynote speaker. They are looking
  forward to welcoming students and advisers to Southern California in April.</span>

<b>Awards and honors:</b>

<b>The Accolade, </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">the newspaper at Sunny Hills High School in Fullerton was named Best High School Newspaper by the Los Angeles Press Club. SCJEA member Tommy Li advises the publication.</span>

<b>Administrator of the Year</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> This year’s award will be presented in Chicago to Rachel Simpson, Head of Covenant of the Sacred Heart High School in San Francisco, Calif. for her continued support of her student
  journalists and adviser Tracy Anne Sena.</span>

<b>Pacemaker Awards </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">16 California schools are Pacemaker finalists in the broadcast and newspaper categories that will be presented in Chicago in Nov.: two in broadcast and 14 in newspaper.</span>

<b>For the Board</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Hopefully you have received the letter from SCJEA president Adriana Chavira regarding planned conventions in Southern California.  As a former convention co-chair, I would like to reiterate and
  support her feelings expressed in that letter. In the years spanning 2011-2027, Southern California will host a total of six conventions from Los Angeles to San Diego.  While these locations are geographically separate, the same committee of
  advisers organizes every convention. On a busy Saturday, that could mean up to six hours of driving to attend planning meetings. While we love hosting students and advisers from across the nation in California, we are concerned about the strain on
  our local professional resources and journalism advisers to have conventions so frequently in the Southern California area. I would respectfully ask you to consider her requests as we move closer to these upcoming conventions and as you schedule
  future conventions in the Southern California region.</span>

<b>Membership: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Colorado has 100 current members. Membership often sees a boost in the fall as schools register for JDay conference and Best in Show competitions.  </span>

<b>Events: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">CSMA kicked off the school year hosting a SNO back to school workshop Aug. 25 at Castle View High School for student media programs wanting to build and refine their websites and including those
  considering building a new one for their school. Students from 11 schools attended in addition to Travis Lambert, an adviser starting a new journalism program and JEA mentor Shelia Jones, CJE.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">CSMA JDay kicked off with celebrations for Adviser of the Year, Jessica Hunziker, MJE, and Administrator of the year, Kevin Taulman of Steamboat Springs High School. A record-breaking 1700 students and advisers filled
  the Lory Student Center on the Colorado State University campus in Ft. Collins Sept. 27 to attend sessions, compete in Best of Show and hear from keynote speaker Mary Beth Tinker, one of the students whose landmark 1969 Supreme Court Case (Tinker
  v. Des Moines Independent School District) helped pave the way for student freedom of expression. JDay ended with All-Colorado awards and announcing Best of Show winners. Ponderosa High School’s yearbook, Eques, was inducted into the All-Colorado
  Hall of Fame.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Upcoming events include CSMA’s winter professional development opportunity for advisers Feb. 2, 2019 and the Capitol Hill Press Conference in February (date and location TBD).</span>

<b>Initiatives/Visions/Concerns: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">CSMA initiatives included adding live stream video and podcast categories for JDay Best of Show and expanding the definition of ‘online’ to include social media as well as website
  news. The board continues to address increasing the number of applications for scholarships and ideas to boost offerings for students at CSMA member schools.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Former Holy Family adviser Traci Mumm came forward in the Denver Post with an account of censorship of her students on the newspaper staff and her subsequent resignation from the private Catholic school in Broomfield,
  CO. The censored article tackled the school’s decision to no longer allow female altar servers. Unfortunately, Colorado’s student freedom of expression law does not apply to private schools, however, CSMA Executive Director Jack Kennedy, MJE did
  weigh in on the issue in the </span><a href="https://www.denverpost.com/2018/08/23/holy-family-newspaper-female-altar-servers/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">article</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span>

  years, we shared a drafted Hawaii New Voices bill with a representative’s office staff, but they directed us to the back to the Hawaii DOE to focus on Board of Education Policy 101-9, School-Sponsored Media. We sent a proposed policy to the

<ul>
  <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">In articles with anonymous sources who admit to breaking school rules or even laws, advisers wonder if school administration can force students or the adviser, or if advisers would be
      required, to reveal sources if asked by school administration?</span></li>
  <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Is parental permission required, for example, if a named student talks to a reporter about gender issues that the student’s parents either are not aware of or do not approve of?</span></li>

<b>Not-so-ups:</b>
<ul>
  <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The state convention in Moscow will attract far less attendance because of Idaho's particular geography among North, Central, and Southern sections, which limits the feasibility of

  <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some members have commented on the liaison with University of Idaho; for example, rather than it expanding the annual conference with financial contributions (and expectations), it has
      limited who may present and where the conference might be held.</span></li>
  <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other funding and locations have presented themselves, and I have basically stayed in reflection mode until the Moscow event is over (the liaison is retiring this year, and it might be

<b>Membership: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Membership is up since last spring, with 86 current members.</span>

<b>Events: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Indiana High School Press Association’s 95th fall state convention took place Oct.19 in Franklin, IN., Students and advisers from around the state listened to keynote speaker Kristina Smekens
  discuss Everything I Need to know, I learned in Journalism. Along with celebrating publication successes with the Hoosier Star honors and individual achievements in the Harvey awards, they also attended sessions in writing, design, photography,
  and leadership.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">State journalists also kicked off their New Voices campaign at the convention, as they hope to prove that the third time is a charm when it comes to getting our New Voices legislation passed. Indiana will add to it’s
  campaign with a newspaper initiative under MJE Tom Gayda’s guidance. Better than just talking about the importance of the bill, Gayda hopes to show the state leaders the power of the student media through a special New Voices newspaper that will
  be sent to legislators and other stakeholders. Written by students and advisers from across the state, Gayda believes this is a great opportunity for students to be part of the process that gives them the protections they deserve.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In an effort to gather supporting evidence for the New Voices campaign, IHSPA put together a survey last spring to gain evidence. When their efforts failed last spring, they discovered that many who opposed the New
  Voices legislation repeatedly said there just isn’t proof that Indiana student journalists and their advisers need protection. IHSPA is attempting to combat that talking point. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">A committee under the direction IHSPA President-Elect April Moss and Department of Education Secondary Literacy Specialist Jordan Pridemore have been busy working to rewrite the State Standards for journalism, student
  media &amp; mass media. The goal of this committee is to align and restructure the current journalism standards to align with the English 11-12 standards so that the INDOE will recognize journalism as an English credit. These changes should
  benefit all programs and hopefully help create new ones. The rewritten standards would be shared this fall in preparation for the 2019-2020 school year.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Indiana High School Press Association is continuing to work on expanding the reach of IHSPA to all corners of the state through Mentoring and Outreach. One way they hope to do this is by reaching out to new advisers
  in an attempt to connect them with the resources of IHSPA and JEA. The IHSPA board approved a new adviser membership incentive for Fall 2018: to pay for a JEA single-year membership fees for up to 10 new IHSPA member advisers.</span>

<b>Awards and Honors: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Congratulations to Lake Central's Sarah Verpooten and Carrie Wadycki for being inducted into Ball State's J Day Hall of Fame.</span>

<b>Membership: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">JEA members in Iowa number 50, slightly more than last year with six new people joining since July. Emails and contact by phone have been utilized to reach out to newer members. </span>

<b>Happenings: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Iowa High School Press Association’s state conference will be held at the University of Iowa Oct. 25. Brian Ross formerly of ABC News is the scheduled speaker. The conference will feature a
  modular schedule. In previous years, most sessions were the same length of time. Now sessions will be different lengths depending on topics being presented.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The All-Iowa News Teams earned banners in lieu of plaques last year, the thinking being the banners are contemporary and would be easier to hang. Positive feedback was given about the banners. The banner awards will
  now be extended to top yearbook staffs.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The On-the-Spot photography contest will be replaced with a social media contest. No lab was available for photography. Posting photos and writing to social media seemed better logistically and a logical fit for
  teenagers.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">It was decided to add the following categories for the 2019 Spring contest: Video News Program, Video and Print Ads, Entertainment and Review.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The Iowa Board of Educational Examiners has created an English All endorsement that will allow English teachers to teach drama, debate and journalism. The journalism endorsement can still be earned after taking 15
  hours of credit. The English All endorsement will require 40 hours in a variety of areas. The implications of this change are not yet known.</span>

<b>Membership: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">JEA membership is up by almost 12 percent in Kansas with 128 members.</span>

<b>Events: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">The biggest news coming out of Kansas scholastic journalism right now is not a happy story. The ACLU has filed suit against the Shawnee Mission School District </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">for
  allegedly violating students' free speech rights. Students complained in April after administrators in several schools allegedly censored students during the nationwide walkouts protesting gun violence. Among other incidents, students said a
  Hocker Grove Middle School principal pushed a student for mentioning school shootings in a speech and an administrator at Shawnee Mission North High School confiscated a student journalist's camera.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a
  statement  to the</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Kansas City Star</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Lauren Bonds, ACLU legal director said, “Instead of simply acknowledging their violation of student First Amendment rights,
  the district appears to be doubling down on the mistakes they’ve made.” She said the ACLU “wouldn’t have even filed the lawsuit had the district simply acknowledged what they’d done wrong and changed its policy.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">KSPA
  will be working with JEA, NSPA, SPLC and other journalistic organizations to file an amicus brief to the court.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The annual fall conference was expanded from three to four sites in the hope of better serving our membership. Instead, attendance dropped significantly and we are working to determine the cause. At the Wichita State,
  K-State and Fort Hays State conferences, Jamie Squire, Getty Images photographer, delivered the keynote. At the University of Kansas, Keith O’Brien, author and reporter, inspired students with his keynote.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The KSPA board is beginning work on a new strategic plan. Our plan is to dream big so that we can do big things. We have an energetic board that is ready to get things done, to ignore old procedures and to seek new
  answers to old questions. Obviously, we don’t know what exactly what the strategic plan will be but we are working to find ways to increase membership through outreach and through taking a hard look at our current programming.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The first round of monthly contests offered by KSPA has already been submitted and is awaiting judging.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">We are proud to announce that Kansas has added a new JEA mentor, Kelly Neiman, retired adviser from Topeka Seaman High School. With a total of three mentors in the state, we are looking forward to an increase in
  the number of young teachers who can be helped and encouraged.</span>

<b>Awards and Honors: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">We are particularly proud of our Kansas student journalists and their advisers and offer a virtual high five to each of the following:</span>
<ul>
  <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">J.D. Garber of Salina Central H.S. was named the winner of the 2018 Jackie Engel Award by the Kansas Collegiate Media. This is the equivalent of the Kansas Journalism Teacher of the
      Year.</span></li>
  <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mrs. Marla Hayden, CTE Coordinator, Wichita Public Schools, was named the Kansas Administrator of the Year. This award recognizes </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">secondary school
      administrators who have stood up for the First Amendment and his/her students.</span></li>
  <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">John Walter of Junction City H.S. received the Sunflower Award which recognizes a new adviser who shows enthusiasm and dedication to building a strong journalism program.</span></li>
  <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Daisy Bolin of Shawnee Mission East. was named the State Student Journalist of the Year and represented Kansas in the national competition. She was the head copy editor for both the
    </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Harbinger</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Harbinger Online</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rock
      Creek Jr/Sr High School student Natalie Lindsey was named 3A/4A Student Journalist of the Year, while Lincoln Jr/Sr High School student Dylan Babcock earned the 1A/2A honor. Bolin received a cash prize of $1,250 while Lindsey and Babcock each
      received $850.</span></li>
  <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aiden Werner, Maize Middle School, was named the winner of the Mary Patrick Aspiring Young Journalist Award which recognized the work of middle school journalism students.</span></li>
  <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yearbook Pacemaker Finalists: Kansas had four finalists last spring and two winners.</span></li>

<b>Membership: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are 34 members in Massachusetts, up from 33 in the spring.</span>

<b>Events: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">I attended the spring convention in San Francisco.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">I attended and presented at the spring conference for the New England Scholastic Press Association (NESPA), as well as represented JEA at the adviser luncheon. I also served as a judge for the annual Special
  Achievement Contests, which honor individual student work.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">I attended the June meeting of the Massachusetts Scholastic Press Association (MASPA), where we discussed, among other things, the perennial topic of how to increase participation in Massachusetts scholastic
  journalism, where there has been an ongoing difficulty in increasing engagement. Two MASPA events that came from this meeting were back-to-school workshops, one for yearbook advisers and one for newspaper advisers. MASPA (and Brian Baron, MJE, is
  the one who does the lion’s share of the work here) is also going to continue the process of having “All-State” honors in journalism, one goal of which is to identify early which students would be good candidates for the Journalist of the Year
  competition, as well as “Best of the Massachusetts High School Press” awards.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">As I serve on the boards of both NESPA and MASPA, as well as JEA state director, I continue to try to use that position to spread the word on scholastic journalism and increase participation for publications, students
  and advisers in all of the organizations.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Outreach continues to try to bring new members into JEA, including directly contacting teachers/advisers.</span>

<b>Membership: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Minnesota has 34 members (up 6 from 28 members last fall) </span>

<b>Key Projects: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Minnesota is currently in a holding pattern with our New Voices Act. We will work to get the bill into committee hearings this upcoming session. Sandra Erickson, a Republican on the education
  committee, (one of the committees that needs to approve the bill) is not supportive of the group’s purpose. One difficult aspect of Minnesota is that we have so many separate groups to gain support from—the principals’ association, the
  superintendents’ association, the school board association, etc. We need to work on getting more testimony from students. We also need to rally parents of our publications students as they are the constituents who vote. Our difficulty is in the
  outlying area of the state where newspaper programs have been cut. It is difficult to make those legislators realize the importance of the bill. We have not had a recent flashpoint to make everyone rally behind the bill. All of our current
  sponsors are Democrats, so we continue to work on securing a Republican sponsor. While our legislature remains a Republican majority, we foresee continued slow progress.</span>

<b>My projects: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to my work on JEA membership, I continue to serve on the NSPA board. As part of a committee to generate increased membership in Minnesota High School Press Association and increase
  attendance to our state convention, we met to discuss an outstate convention--a smaller convention model in the northern area of the state. That way, schools from the outlying areas can take part in the state convention activities. We had a
  volunteer area, but the plans fell through when the site volunteers needed to know exactly how many people were coming. This was not possible, so at the end of summer, we shifted gears, and committee members met again to discuss an outreach plan
  to outlying advisers. MHSPA provided postcards inviting outstate advisers to come to the state convention on their own, and MHSPA/JEM would provide a night in a hotel prior to the state convention, a dinner and free registration to the convention.
  Our goal is to encourage these advisers that the convention events and networking is valuable, and, hopefully, they will bring their students next year. After the postcards were sent out by MHSPA, I also sent out note cards introducing myself and
  offering my help in any journalistic area. I also hand wrote a personal invitation to come to the state convention. So far, two outstate advisers have accepted the invitation. To kick off this new idea, we added an additional event on the Monday
  evening before our convention. Laura Widmer and the staff at the NSPA/MHSPA offices will host a pizza/salad night to welcome these outstate advisers.  </span>

<b>Awards/Events, MHSPA Convention, Oct. 9: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Minnesota State High School Press Convention is on Tuesday, Oct. 9 at the University of Minnesota. Local reporter Lindsey Seavert and photojournalist Ben Garvin will
  keynote the event. Seavert and Garvin recently completed a documentary project for KARE 11 news called “Lessons from Lucy Laney.” The work focuses on people who made a difference in the lives of grade school children. Ninety percent of the
  students at Lucy Laney School live in poverty. Seavert and Garvin will discuss how they found the stories in this series and the impact the project had on their storytelling. The current number of registered attendees is 431 students and advisers.
  Awards announced at the state convention include Gold Medallions (individual awards sponsored by MHSPA), Best of Show (in yearbook, newspaper, online newspaper and literary magazine, also sponsored by MHSPA) and All-State (a
  JEM-sponsored competition that awards gold, silver or bronze recognition and provides a mini-critique.)</span>

<b>Upcoming Events: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Minnesota’s annual Arts Journalism Day at the Guthrie is in the planning stages. Students will tour the theater, discuss review writing with an arts critic from the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Star
    Tribune</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and then view a matinee of a play (TBA). This event was cancelled due to lack of interest last spring, but I plan to offer it again to see what happens. </span>

<b>Shout-Outs: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Minnesota journalism community is proud of Rachel Steil, CJE, who is the Minnesota Journalism Educator of the Year. Rachel advises the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pony Express </span></i><span
  style="font-weight: 400;">print and online newspapers at Stillwater Area High School in Stillwater, MN. Reid Westrum was also honored this year in the Minnesota Journalism Educator contest. Westrum advises the print and online newspapers and the
  yearbook for Minnehaha Academy in Minneapolis.  </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">A shout out also goes to Lori Keekley, MJE, Scholastic Press Rights Director, for her work over the summer on a New Voices legislation website that will serve as a resource for those states working to pass
  anti-Hazelwood legislation.  </span>

<b>Membership: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are 14 JEA members in Mississippi, 3 of which are new members. Membership is encouraged at all Mississippi Scholastic Press Association (MSPA) events and a link to future JEA conventions is
  posted on the MSPA website. JEA Membership is one of the first planks we talk about with new advisers at our Adviser Institute each June.</span>

<b>Events: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">MSPA will host its second annual statewide fall convention Oct. 25 at the University of Southern Mississippi (a new partner in crime). At our first event last year, we had 440 students from 28 schools!
  Many were already members, but several were new schools who would never have traveled to our other events at Ole Miss. This is an exciting new system for us, and I look forward to seeing how things play out this fall. Our traditional Spring
  Convention (formerly our only statewide event) will be April 1 at Ole Miss.</span>

<b>Awards and honors:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Schools submitted entries for our yearbook and literary magazine contests back in September, and we saw an increase in our lit mag entries from 7 to 10 schools. After hearing about the
  successes of our friends at MIPA in Michigan, this spring MSPA will eliminate its Editor of the Year &amp; other top individual awards and replace them with one pool of students recognized as “All-Mississippi.” Students will be required to submit

<b>First Amendment-related concerns:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though no major issues are pressing, Mississippi continues to struggle, as many states do, with heavy-handed administrators, prior review and de facto censorship. It has
  occurred to me that school administrators most likely have differing ideas about what the First Amendment even</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">means</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and I am currently developing a qualitative
  study instrument in order to research this theory at high schools across the South.</span>

<b>For the board: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">I am excited to see the JEA Adviser Institute relocate to our backyard. Engaging, educating and empowering journalism advisers in a region plagued by poverty and underfunding is a wise strategic
  positioning, and I hope Mississippi can be of help moving forward.</span>

<b>Membership: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although Montana has always reported a small but relatively stable membership, interest in attending and participating in fall/spring meetings/contests has once again diminished. The number of
  returning members has diminished. This is due in part to retiring advisers and cuts in co-curricular programs. However, the number of new advisers has started to encourage the MJEA board. Currently, MJEA has 21 members, which is an increase from
  last fall, and although we have recently had an addition of two new JEA members, these advisers have not joined MJEA. Our membership also includes two of Linda Ballew’s new mentees who have been given honorary two-year memberships.</span>
<ul>
  <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">MJEA’s highly motivated and action-orientated president. Beth Britton, CJE, the CMR adviser of the Stampede and Russellog from Great Falls, MT, continues to diligently work to assist
      the state’s journalism advisers through the dissemination of information and resources, working closely with the University of Montana School of Journalism and JEA’s state director Linda Ballew, MJE. She is beginning her sixth year as MJEA
      president.</span></li>
  <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Both Beth and Linda continue to request input on how to reorganize the association as well as what kind of resources would assist Montana advisers more effectively. Advisers are willing
      to use the resources Beth and Linda provide; however, they are not willing to engage in working within the framework of the organization.</span></li>
  <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">To gain a better understanding of this issue, we have reached out to former members and high school journalism programs throughout the state with surveys, emails, letters and requests
      to submit and participate in adding content and providing suggestions for updating mjeajournalism.com</span></li>
  <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The gap left in MJEA’s executive board continues to not be filled. We hope to encourage younger members to become engaged in MJEA. Montana journalism programs have undergone dramatic
      turnover with new advisers taking the helm of journalism programs in many of the small, rural as well as larger high schools. It is obvious that younger advisers need to find reasons to be professionally involved with our organization to
      revitalize what MJEA can offer to a diverse state membership.</span></li>
  <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Maintaining and expanding MJEA and JEA membership continues as always to be a top priority.</span></li>
  <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Britton and Ballew continue to email advisers encouraging them to communicate with us, retain membership in MJEA and JEA and participate in adding content and discussion to
      mjeajournalism.com</span></li>
  <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Britton and Ballew have continued to send resource materials and membership forms in the mail encouraging communication and membership in MJEA and JEA.</span></li>
  <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ballew has an outreach to new advisers through JEA’s Mentor Program. She currently has two Montana mentees in Lewistown and Billings, and one in Las Vegas. These advisers have been
      given access to MJEA and JEA membership.</span></li>
  <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yearbook advisers comprise a majority of MJEA’s membership. Britton and Ballew have decided to take on more responsibility for the state journalism contest to ensure that yearbook
      programs as well as social media programs will continue to have critique and contest services as well as the current newspaper and online publications. These have begun this fall of with an emphasis on broadcast workshops as this is how our
      advisers will be able to apply for CTE in Montana.</span></li>
  <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Information regarding the fall convention in Chicago, resources from the New York Times, various articles and a look at an amazing multimedia project are only a few of the posts on our </span><a
      href="https://mjeajournalism.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">website</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. This site continues to provide resources and information. Britton has also requested the following from our members and
      state advisers encouraging them to post to the site:</span></li>
  <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">1. Photos of their students in action, their classrooms, guest speakers, etc.</span></li>
  <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">2. Short opinion pieces written by advisers. Britton would like to have their voices on the site.</span></li>
  <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">3. Ideas for other advisers – lessons, celebrations, classroom set-up… </span></li>
  <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">There will be no MJEA presence at this year’s MFPE convention in Billings, MT. MJEA with PBS will offer a two-day broadcast workshop for students and advisers instead. </span></li>
  <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">We are hoping for a larger presence at next year’s teachers’ convention and in the future – The 2020 teachers’ conference will be in Great Falls. We will be there!</span></li>
  <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Developing interest in JEA membership has also been encouraged by pointing to the value of JEA’s dynamic journalism curriculum. This continues to perk interest in JEA. Advisers express
      their appreciation for the thorough and in-depth lessons, rubrics, Common Core Standards’ alignment and assessments that they can access for both in their classrooms as well as with administrators who want advisers to demonstrate curricular
      accountability.</span></li>
  <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">We appreciate JEA’s interest in their outreach to our advisers as two of Montana’s advisers from Garfield High School were chosen for the JEA/NSPA Partner Project. MJEA had wished for
      more contact and an ability to participate with these two young advisers, one of whom is not an MJEA member. Neither of these advisers have contacted MJEA even though multiple attempts to reach out to them have been made.</span></li>
  <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">We had hoped for more input into the date of the workshop as we made efforts to have other Montana advisers participate, but the date did not work for many of them, and they were unable
      to participate in this workshop.</span></li>
  <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Importantly. MJEA would very much like to say, Thank You to Michelle Balmeo, MJE, Ellen Austin, MJE and JEA/NSPA for traveling to Montana and providing such an extraordinary experience
      for these two advisers and their students. This was a remarkable opportunity. Read about the Partner Project experience in Jordan </span><a href="http://jea.org/wp/blog/2018/09/06/partner-project-update/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">here</span></a><span

<b>Happenings:</b>
<ul>
  <li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>2018 Student Reporting Labs at PBS NewsHour: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Montana PBS, based out of Bozeman, Montana, is offering a free two-day workshop for Montana’s high school journalism students and
      educators Oct. 18-19. This has been in the works for several months, and teachers who attend will earn OPI credit. The workshop is designed for both beginner and more advanced broadcast programs. One of PBS’s goals is to make connections with
      young journalists throughout Montana, and eventually feature much of their work on the station. As more and more journalism programs move online, the video component of reporting is increasingly important and relevant to young readers/viewers.
      The workshop will be led by PBS producers Chris Seifert and Beth Saboe -- along with several people from the Student Reporting Labs at PBS NewsHour.</span></li>
  <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The first day of the workshop will focus on ethics, lighting, audio and shooting. Each school will bring its own equipment so the professionals at PBS can help everyone learn to make
      the best use of what they already have without the need to purchase expensive equipment. The second day will find the young journalists and their teachers out capturing footage in Bozeman. They will return and learn the basics of editing,
      logging and storing that footage. The workshop will end when each group shares its project.</span></li>
  <li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>The JEA office</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has been an essential asset because of the wonderful people in the office. They continue to help us by sending support materials as we try to enlist new members.
      The staff has also been essential in helping with materials that reinforce classroom issues and support Linda’s mentees.Thank you so much!</span></li>
</ul>
<b>For the Board:</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">From MJEA president, Beth Britton: </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Funding and support for scholastic journalism in the state of Montana is on shaky ground. Few schools offer journalism classes, and even many
  of the largest AA schools offer little more than a yearbook class or club. There are a few programs that continue to publish newspapers, offer introductory journalism classes and produce broadcast options. We at MJEA continue to stress the
  importance of journalism in the overall curriculum and aim to grow our numbers. Developing a support system for the few of us who teach journalism in the massive Big Sky Country is key – we need to bridge the hundreds of miles that separate our
  schools.”</span>

<b>For the board: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">As numbers for scholastic journalism programs across the state of Nevada continue to fluctuate, with more fluctuating in a downward fashion, it would be great to have a current,

  Unfortunately, some of the data is starting to show its age and it would be great if JEA could find a way to partner or encourage an updated study to help out those that need a resource such as this.</span>

<b>Membership: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our membership has grown to 65 members, which is a more than 10 percent growth since the spring.  Our monthly GSSPA meetings typically have 10 to 20 members present, so we would love to not only
  increase our membership, but to also increase the number of people we see on a monthly basis.  If you are interested, please email me at</span><a href="mailto:greggagliardi@gmail.com"><span style="font-weight: 400;">greggagliardi@gmail.com</span></a><span
  style="font-weight: 400;">.  We have monthly meetings in Clark, NJ, and dinner is always provided.</span>

<b>Events: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">We are currently planning our annual fall conference, which takes place at Rutgers University in New Brunswick Monday, Oct. 29, two days before some of us will take off for Chicago.  There will be two
  on-site competitions -- one for writing and another for social media -- as well as four different time slots of sessions. Schools will find out who won individual awards for online, print, broadcast and yearbook.  Our biggest awards -- the
  Distinguished Journalism Award and Overall Excellence -- will be presented at the start of the day.</span>

<b>Awards and honors: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">The GSSPA </span><a href="https://gsspa.org/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">website</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> will soon include the finalists for each of the awards
  referred to above.  Our</span><a href="http://twitter.com/gsspa"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Twitter account</span></a> <span style="font-weight: 400;"> has them in the meantime.  Last year NJ had more teams as finalists in the Quiz Bowl than
  any other state and is hoping to make waves in this competition once again. Most schools in New Jersey did not start until September, so for most advisers, the year is still young and plans are still underway for publishing a first issue.</span>

<b>Membership:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Current membership is 21. We are up five more new members from my spring semi-annual report. After speaking with several journalism educators, it looks like the work I will be doing with the New
  Mexico Public Education Department will continue to increase our numbers. There has been more inquiry and interest in how JEA can assist in professional development. Based on the meeting scheduled with the College and Career Readiness Bureau March
  15, 2018 to discuss the journalism/communications pathway of study for our state, a committee has been formed to work on this pathway and to promote the importance of journalism education to high school administrators. Based on changes in
  graduation requirements for the class of 2022, the communication pathway could count as an alternative assessment in writing. The request needs to be sent to NMPED by January and we are hard at work to meet this deadline.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">I will continue to reach out to New Mexico journalism advisers to increase NM membership. However, I believe that this initiative will be a positive catalyst to increasing these numbers. </span>

<b>Events/Happenings:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The NMSPA State Leadership Conference will be hosted in January in Las Cruces, NM at Centennial High School. This will be the first year that the conference will be hosted outside of the
  Albuquerque area and planning for the event started Aug. 22, 2018 hosted by NMSPA President, Rebeca Zimmermann. The increasing involvement of students and schools has begun to take some of the pressure from previous concerns on the lack of schools
  competing which may negatively affect our current NMAA standing. With the new venue, we are hoping to see an increase of participation from those schools located in the southern region of the state. Last year we saw an increase in attendance,
  which was exciting. Based on the growth of broadcast programs, there will be a need to develop more on-site competitions. The summer journalism workshop hosted by Rory McClanahan, NMPA President, was rejuvenated and plans are in place to continue
  the event.</span>

<b>First Amendment Issues:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> I have been asked to speak at the New Mexico Council for Teachers of English Oct. 27, 2018. The theme for this year’s Fall conference is Nuestras Voices-Speaking out for Equity and
  Justice. This conference is a good fit to engage attendees in dialogue around the New Voices movement and spark interest in the movement here in New Mexico. I have reached out to Lori Keekley, MJE, who is assisting me with resources.  </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Our state concerns continue; however, I am actively meeting with representatives from the NM Public Education Department to address the concerns expressed from the members of JEA and continue to meet NMPED throughout
  the year. I have copied these concerns form my last report:</span>
<ul>
  <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">As I have been meeting with advisers two major concerns have come up. First, there has been a trend in schools cutting yearbook programs and journalism programs, moving them to a club
      activity and/or after school program. The number of students enrolling in student newspaper has decreased since the state took away the communications credit and changed to an elective credit. Additionally, programs are not receiving funding
      to support printing and/or to revamp their programs to meet a more modern newsroom.</span></li>
  <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The second area of concern is the lack of publications policies in school districts and the challenges of trying to get publications policies adopted by school districts. For example, I
      tried to submit a policy from the NSPA to be read by our school board for adoption. I was not put on the agenda and received an email from the superintendent with a document from the school’s lawyer stating that what I proposed was not
      necessary and sent a policy that spoke more about student council than student publications. After speaking with individuals from other school districts, we noticed the same trend with journalism advisers appealing to school districts to adopt
      publications policies and receiving similar policies that do not truly address student publications.  </span></li>
</ul>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Conversation is in the works to add our state to the New Voices movement to change the mindset about student journalism and the positive impact these programs have on developing students into active, free thinking and
  well informed members of society that should have a voice.  </span>

<b>For the Board:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> I am excited to report that in January 2018, Yearbook and Newspaper were added to section ‘W’ of the NM STARS reporting which now qualifies these programs to not only be considered as English
  electives, but they can also qualify as CTE programs. Currently, the state is changing qualifications for alternative graduation requirements for the class of 2022 with CTE students under this umbrella of change. Because of this update, NM JEA
  members are working on further developing the communications pathway of study in under to be added to section ‘E’ of the NM STARS reporting system in order to qualify as one of the pathway options that would assist students with the updated
  graduation requirements. As I continue to meet with representatives of NMPED/CCRB, the focus of these conversations is the continuous development of the communications pathway of study. It is important to continue promoting the resources and
  opportunities for professional development considering JEA as the vehicle for training and further development for future journalism educators will be a key as these conversations move forward.</span>

  Advisers Association.</span>

<b>Events:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> North Carolina Scholastic Media Association continues to partner with Kettering Foundation’s National Forums Institute on a pilot program for North Carolina, exploring how scholastic journalism programs
  can make use of NIFI resource guides and deliberation forums. Kettering representatives have met with the North Carolina Scholastic Media Advisers Association board and have traveled to Chapel Hill to teach student leadership sessions. And now
  NCSMA Director Monica Hill, CJE, and outgoing NIFI board member Dr. Jerry Brown will bring the NIFI resources to the National High School Journalism Convention in Chicago. North Carolina adviser Bryan Christopher, who has taught NIFI sessions at
  NCSMA events, will also offer two sessions in Chicago, one for students and one for teachers.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Our Mountains to Coast fall regional workshops will conclude Nov. 8 with the South-central Piedmont Regional Workshop sponsored by The Charlotte Observer.  Our four workshops are co-hosted with news outlets and
  universities across our state. They offer low-cost workshops for students who may not otherwise attend a scholastic journalism event. Registration fee of $15 includes lunch. We begin Oct. 9 at Appalachian State University, then travel to
  UNC-Chapel Hill, then across the state to East Carolina University in Greenville.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Former Sports Illustrated writer Tim Crothers continues to offer top-notch sports journalism instruction to students who participate in the Carolina Sports Journalism Camp. Forty students from across the country take

<b>Membership: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Ohio JEA membership is at 78 members, up from 58 members since the spring report. Efforts are being made to recruit JEA members in Ohio. The Ohio Scholastic Media Association (OSMA) currently
  offers JEA membership through the state registration forms and Maggie Cogar, CJE, Ohio JEA state director, and Candace Bowen, MJE, use state press association events to inform Ohio advisers on the benefits of joining JEA. Also, email marketing
  using Constant Contact newsletters are being sent to all JEA and OSMA members, as well as to a database of over 800 administrators across the state, in an attempt to increase membership for both JEA and OSMA.</span>

<b>Events: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ohio JEA and OSMA continue to offer events for scholastic media advisers and student journalists throughout the school year. This fall, the OSMA executive board will host three regional workshops in
  October. The region 1 workshop at Kent State was Oct. 4, the region 5 workshop at Otterbein University was Oct. 8 and the region 4 workshop at Bowling Green State University was Oct. 15. While region 1 and region 5 in the state continue to show
  growth, the OSMA executive board is struggling to keep a fall workshop going in region 4, or the northwest part of the state, where numbers remain low. The board also struggles to reach advisers in the southwest and southeast regions of the state,
  an issue that is actively discussed at every meeting. Audrey Wagstaff, MJE, is currently working to get a region 3 fall workshop going at Wilmington College for Fall 2019.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The annual state convention will be held April 12-13, 2019 at Kent State University, where the board anticipates over 500 students and advisers in attendance. This event is where the state will also award over 1,000
  individual awards to student journalists in pre-entered categories in writing, design, photography, broadcast, yearbook and online.</span>

<b>Awards and honors: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Julieanne Ford, Lakota East High School, was the state winner in the 2018 Ohio Journalist of the Year competition (Dean Hume, adviser).</span>

<b>For the board: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the largest accomplishments and highlights of OSMA in recent years is the addition of an active OSMA student board. This student board, advised by JEA members Karen Allen and Dean Hume, is
  comprised of 11 students from regions across the state. Student representatives attend two meetings a year and organize sessions for both the fall workshops and spring state convention. They also offer feedback after each workshop or convention
  and that feedback has led OSMA to offer different types of sessions and change the schedule of workshops to better meet student and adviser needs. Most importantly, it has allowed students to have a voice within the organization.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The OSMA executive board is also in the process of updating the rubrics used to judge the state competition. The rubric committee (led by JEA members Juli McClain, CJE, Angela Spano, CJE, and John Bowen, MJE) is in
  the process of updating the judging rubrics to address adviser concerns. Also in Ohio, JEA member Mark Goodman is leading the process of gathering evidence to support New Voices Legislation. He is currently seeking testimony from advisers and
  student journalists in Ohio to support legislative efforts. I am currently working on my dissertation proposal titled “Censorship in High School Journalism: Examining administrative censorship practices and other factors in relation to the degree
  of student self-censorship.” This research, funded by the 2017 JEA national research grant, will focus on factors that correlate to student self-censorship rates, including examining the correlation rate of self-censorship to the rate of perceived
  administrative censorship. My goal is to have my dissertation proposal approved in time to conduct student survey research at the JEA/NSPA national convention in April 2019.</span>

<b>Events:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The Pennsylvania School Press Association (PSPA) will host Student Journalism Competitions (SJCs) at six regional venues across the state throughout fall 2018. We have added a new site at
  Indiana University of Pennsylvania. We have also made changes to the photo competition (three photos representing assigned content) and the broadcast competition (up to three students can enter the broadcast carry-in as a team). Student winners in
  each category will compete at the statewide event hosted at the main campus of Penn State University in March. Further details about this event will be decided later in the year. Sample prompts were also made available to advisers this year to
  assist their students’ preparation for the regional competitions.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">During our PSPA board meeting in July, Hadar Harris from SPLC shared information with us about New Voices, so each SJC location will have the option of including a similar presentation in the agenda for their event.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">We are consistently looking for ways to increase opportunities for students to showcase their skills. The board welcomed two new PSPA members at the July meeting. In the spring, board members revised the newspaper
  rubric for summer critiques, and developed a new rubric and contest for web submissions. One school received a Gold rating for this new competition, The Friar’s Lantern from Malvern Preparatory School in Malvern, PA. Summer critiques are complete.
  Schools that earned a Gold rating will move onto the Keystone Award selection to be announced at the SJC finals in March.</span>

<b>Membership:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> South Dakota has seven members, up from three since the spring report. Members received an introductory email from the new state director that included information about the grant for
  first-timeconvention attendees. We plan to discuss JEA membership during the advisers’ meeting that will take place in conjunction with our fall convention.  </span>

<b>Events:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The South Dakota High School Press Convention is shifting from spring to fall in 2018, so we are preparing to host our second one of the year Oct. 15 at South Dakota State University. We expect more
  than 225 students from throughout the state to attend, along with their advisers. Lori Keekley, director of the JEA Scholastic Press Rights Committee, is the keynote speaker. Our summer high school journalism camp was cancelled, but we are
  optimistic about offering one in 2019.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">South Dakota joined the New Voices campaign, thanks to an effort led by Gage Gramlick, editor-in-chief of the Statesman at Lincoln High School in Sioux Falls. Gage gave a brief presentation at the spring convention
  and has been invited to do so again at the fall event.</span>

<b>Awards and honors:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> We held a high school journalist of the year competition in the spring for the first time in several years. The contest was not aligned with the national JOY program; we are looking at doing
  that in 2019. In addition, the South Dakota High School Activities Association conducts an annual contest to recognize excellence in newswriting, photography, newspaper and yearbook. The contest is being held twice this year in order to keep it
  aligned with the state convention.</span>

<b>Membership:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Vermont currently has five members.</span>

<b>Events:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">  News outlets in Vermont reported Sept. 11, 2018 that the principal of Burlington (Vermont) High School had censored the student newspaper, "The Register," in violation of Vermont's New Voices law,
  signed by Vermont's governor in May 2017. Using public records, the students were the first to report that the Vermont Agency of Education had filed a series of licensing violations against the school's guidance director. The account of the
  censorship was also posted on the JEA Listserv. I read that the newspaper staff had already contacted the Student Press Law Center. I emailed both the adviser to ask how I could help and the VTDigger reporter to comment on his reporting. I
  suggested he say "student newspaper" instead of "school newspaper." He called, and I spoke with him a couple of times. The adviser and I exchanged several emails over the next several days. I express-mailed her a copy of Quill and Scroll's
  "Principal's Guide to Scholastic Journalism," and I suggested she contact John Bowen, MJE, who put her in touch with Lori Keekley, MJE, the new SPRC director. After other news outlets reported the story, the principal allowed the students
  to repost the story and required The Register's staff to submit all articles to him 48 hours before posting. Because of the subsequent uproar with the Vermont Press Association and others speaking out about these violations of Vermont law, the
  school
  board decided that the student journalists, the adviser, and others would develop a publications policy in line with Vermont law.</span>

<b>Membership: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia currently has 101 members, an increase of 13 from the previous report.</span>

<b>Events: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">We are excited to renew our relationship with the Virginia High School League (VHSL), and co-sponsor the VHSL Media Championship Oct. 20 at Harrisonburg High School, in Harrisonburg, Va. Previously a
  series of championships held at various locations across the state, this year’s event will be a one-day workshop with strands for advisers, yearbook, newspaper, web, photography, broadcast, literary magazine and general topics. Shari Adwers, MJE,
  now a resident of the Commonwealth and teaching at Loudoun Valley High School, will be our keynote speaker. Other featured speakers include Kelly Furnas, MJE, from Elon University, previous advisers of the year Martha Akers, Mary Kay Downes, MJE,
  Alan Weintraut and Chris Waugaman,MJE, and JEA Curriculum Leader Abri Nelson, CJE.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">One of these sessions will be a discussion of JEA’s One Book, “The Hate U Give,” which is timely, considering the movie comes out in theaters Oct. 5.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">As we move forward with our New Voices initiative, one of sessions, led by James Madison University’s </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Roger Soenksen, will address issues on general student press rights,
  defamation, privacy rights and take-down requests.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition, we will also be administering the Certified Journalism Educator exam to five Virginia JEA members in the afternoon.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The VHSL Awards Ceremony will take place during the last block of the day, where VHSL will award Individual Multimedia Awards, critique awards and the Savedge Award for Sustained Excellence in Scholastic Journalism.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Planning for the 2019 JEA/NSPA in Washington, D.C., has already begun under the leadership of local committee chair, Meghan Percival, MJE. We have a logo, a slogan, a t-shirt design and many, many ideas to help
  attendees remember that journalism matters now more than ever.</span>

<b>Awards: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was an extremely exciting spring for Virginia Journalism - and for me. Christine Zhao, the Virginia Journalist of the Year, was named the National High School Journalist of the Year, a first for
  Virginia. Unfortunately, Christine was not in San Francisco for the convention, but I was speechless on her behalf for a solid 24 hours after the announcement. Christine will be joining us in Chicago as a speaker at the Thursday keynote.</span>

<b>Update on New Voices legislation:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> New Voices is a student-powered project of the Student Press Law Center, a nonprofit advocate for the rights of student journalists. Organizations across Wisconsin are pushing
  for new laws that protect the rights of student journalists from censorship by school administration. This past August, KEMPA, NEWSPA and the Wisconsin College Media Association formed a coalition to write drafts of anti-censorship legislation and
  gather support. As of today, the campaign is still persisting in raising awareness and pushing for protection from censorship. As of now, there are campaigns in 20 of 50 states for protection from administration censorship, including Wisconsin;
  three states have guaranteed protection for high school and college students from censorship (North Dakota, Oregon, California); and six states (Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, Iowa, Kansas, Colorado, and Arkansas) and the District of Columbia have
  added protection for high school students only. In the remaining 21 states, no laws or campaigns exist. Follow</span><a href="https://www.facebook.com/newvoiceswisconsin/?fref=ts"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">New Voices of Wisconsin</span></a><span
  style="font-weight: 400;"> on Facebook for more information and updates on the campaign. There are no new recent updates on the Wisconsin New Voices front since this past report.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">I hope you had a great summer and are starting the year off well.  We, at the Student Press Law Center, have been gearing up and getting ready to help you fight the good fights for student press freedom.</span>

<b>New School Year, New Battles!</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The school year ended last year with a high profile censorship battle at Prosper High School in Prosper, Texas and has started out with an equally contentious fight at Burlington High School in Vermont. Both cases
  were caused by a principal censoring the important work of student journalists.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In the Texas case, over the course of the school year, the principal censored several different articles in the Eagle News Online which he said did not show the school in a positive light.  He then banned the student
  editors from publishing any editorials. He also implemented a strict prior review policy. In the midst of these new policies, Prosper High School’s award winning journalism adviser, Lori Oglesbee-Petter, did not have her contract renewed and was
  forced to retire.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The Student Press Law Center brought together 18 national organizations to send a letter to the Prosper school district superintendent, urging review of this policy and offering to assist the school district in
  writing a policy which would protect student press freedoms.  The case received local and national news attention with multiple articles in the Dallas Morning News and local television stations, as well as an article in the New York Times. Despite
  the widespread national condemnation and concern, the issues were largely handled through public pressure and awareness building as Texas does not have New Voices student press freedom legislative protections.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">After an intense summer, the principal met with the student editors at the start of the school year and he rescinded the “no editorials” policy as well as the prior review. Students are still waiting to see how things
  play out and SPLC is monitoring the situation carefully.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In early September in Vermont, an interim principal demanded that the student editors of the BHS Register take down a story that they broke using public records and great journalism, regarding the investigation of the
  school’s director of guidance by the Vermont Agency for Education.  The story reported on multiple allegations of misconduct and a plan to censure the guidance director.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to widespread news coverage in Vermont publicizing the take down demand, coverage by the Associated Press made the national wire. Along with the students, SPLC was in constant contact with the
  Vermont Press Association and the New England First Amendment Coalition to coordinate efforts.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">After a flurry of attention, the principal allowed the story to be republished (explaining that since the story had been publicized in other news outlets, he would allow it), but the following day, he announced that
  he was “reinstituting” a strict 48-hour prior review policy that would apply to all student articles.  A similar prior review policy had been abolished after New Voices student press freedom legislation was adopted in Vermont in 2017.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">A further outcry ensued.  SPLC and the Vermont Press Association worked with the students to ensure that administrators, students and the media understood Vermont’s New Voices legislation protections.  Within 24 hours
  of the illegal prior review policy being announced, the Burlington School District issued a press release announcing the reversal of the prior review policy. They wrote,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“All previously practiced or adopted
  guidelines regarding publications in the BHS Register are no longer in effect” and student press policy will be consistent with the “provisions of the New Voices law.”</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The difference between these cases?</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Vermont has a New Voices law and students were able to directly point to the protections in the law to demonstrate that both the take down demand and the prior review policy were illegal.  Texas does not. Once the
  Burlington School District understood what was happening, they overruled the principal and reaffirmed their commitment to student press freedoms and the New Voices law.  </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In Texas, there is no such legal protection and the students are left hanging in a wait-and-see situation. The best outcome in Texas so far? A galvanized movement for New Voices legislation.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The New Voices movement is a grassroots, student-driven movement to protect students from censorship and to adopt student free press legislation in all 50 states and U.S. territories. Named after the John Wall New
  Voices Act adopted by North Dakota in 2015, today 14 states have adopted New Voices protections. The Student Press Law Center provides strategic support and a collaborative space for New Voices groups to organize.  This fall, we have a variety of
  activities planned to help coordinate among activists, to share strategies, build momentum, and develop a national narrative around the need for New Voices legislation. You can join!</span>

<b>New Voices Summits are Coming!</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">As we move New Voices work into high gear, this fall SPLC will be holding the first New Voices Summits at the JEA/NSPC and CMA/ACP Fall Conventions.  Organized in partnership with the JEA Scholastic Press Rights
  Committee, the high school New Voices Summit will take place on Thursday afternoon, Nov. 1 in Chicago prior to the official start of the JEA Fall National Convention.  Participants will share experiences, strategies, successes and frustrations and
  will learn from one another as they develop strategies to move New Voices forward. They will also start making plans for Student Free Press Day in January. The Summit is free but registration through JEA is required. If you are interested in
  getting involved in New Voices, start following your state’s New Voices Facebook page and post a message so people know you’re there!</span>

<b>We are NOT the Enemy!</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to the New Voices Summit, SPLC will be conducting at least eight formal sessions at the JEA/NSPA Fall Convention in Chicago. Among the most interesting sessions will be a session at 10 a.m. on Saturday,
  Nov. 3 entitled, “We are NOT the Enemy!” This session is meant to highlight the great work of student journalists who are making a positive difference in the world.  Please come and share your stories and experiences. Just as we focus on fighting
  censorship and promoting access to information, we also want to elevate and amplify the good work of dedicated student journalists. We will be taping the session to help us illustrate why good student journalism is so important and has such an
  impact.  Please join us to tell your stories.</span>

<b>Get Ready!  Student Free Press Day is Wednesday, January 30, 2019!!</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Last year, to note the 30</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">th</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> anniversary of the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hazelwood School District v. Kuhlmeier</span></i><span
  style="font-weight: 400;"> case which gives public schools broad permission to censor student journalists, the Student Press Law Center sponsored “Hazelwood Day.”  Students, advisers, professional journalists, lawyers and others from across
  the United States posted photos on social media, created short films, coordinated op-eds, brought speakers to campus and took many other actions to note the day and raise awareness about the incidence of censorship of student journalists.  This
  year, we are broadening the call and hoping to capture a wider audience by renaming it Student Free Press Day (#FreePress). Our goal is to raise awareness of the need for student free press protections and the insidious impact of censorship (in
  both public and private schools). It’s not too early to start thinking about what you, your school, your friends and your community can do to mark Student Free Press Day.  Resources and information will be available soon on the SPLC</span><a href="http://www.splc.org/"><span
    style="font-weight: 400;">website</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.  If you would like to join a national planning group or would like to co-sponsor the day, please contact me at hharris@splc.org. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">And always remember that if you have questions or need help with any legal issues that arise, you can always contact the SPLC legal hotline </span><a href="http://www.splc.org/page/legalrequest"><span style="font-weight: 400;">here</span></a><span
  style="font-weight: 400;">.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Good luck for a productive, uncensored school year! </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">As part of JEA’s new partnership with the National Association of Media Literacy Education (NAMLE), I’ve been working with the Media Literacy Week Resource and Content Team with my focus on Higher Ed learning
  materials.  There are plenty of options for being engaged during</span><a href="https://medialiteracyweek.us/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Media Literacy Week</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from Nov. 5-9.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Please feel free to check out the resources offered at the site which can be used anytime and in a variety of classroom settings.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">I’m also reviewing books and resources for the Journal of Media Literacy Education (JMLE) to share useful resources across academic circles.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">My dissertation research is delving more intensely into the concept of trust in the media—particularly student journalism—and has provided some interesting insights on how the current perceptions of mainstream media
  are affecting the way students trust peer voices. I look forward to sharing some of these findings in C:JET in the near future.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The Ohio New Voices legislation team has been moving forward as well, and much will depend on the outcome of the midterm elections.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">If the board has specific suggestions for any higher education-related initiatives, please be in touch. Thanks!</span>
